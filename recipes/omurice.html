        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Omurice, believe it or not, is a simplistic, classic dish.  Someone once wrote that it is the Japanese answer to a grilled cheese sandwich: nostalgic, easy, and perfect for brunches and kids’ breakfasts.  So, for someone trying to be as professional with their cooking and impress their crush, it makes sense for Minko to shoot down the omurice idea for her menu. On the other hand, this filling meal is probably a perfect (and delicious) way to let a person know that you like them.  Either way, omurice is a wonderful dish to start off your morning or afternoon.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups of cooked white rice </li>
            <li>1 small, boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 mushrooms</li>
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Vegatable or Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up the mushrooms, onions, garlic, and chicken.  I recommend cooking the chicken in the oven a bit, first, with some seasonings (I just use salt, pepper, and some curry powder), so you won’t have to worry about raw chicken.</li>

            <li>Once the onion becomes clear, add in the rice, and the rest of the ketchup and soy sauce.  Mix everything together.  Once the rice is hot, and thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, put it all in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Put a small amount of oil in the pan, and then pour the beaten eggs into the pan.  Lift up the pan and tilt it around in a circle so that the egg covers all sides of the pan.  Let the egg cook, occasionally lifting up the egg from the sides of the pan to make sure it doesn’t stick.  If you can manage it, flip the egg sheet over to cook on the other side.  If you can’t, then just turn the heat down to low and wait for the egg to cook all the way through.  You can try to cook the rice into the omlette before it cooks through, but I find it difficult to transfer to the plate if I do it that way.</li>
